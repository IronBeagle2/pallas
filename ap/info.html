    <h1>Alpha Mod</h1>
    <p>
        Alpha Mod was created in 2018 after I decided I wanted to make something like a texture pack but extended.
        <br><br>
        It originally started as something very simple, but as the time went by, I started adding a lot of options that
        made the game be more like Old Days, and you could select different world generators, or have Early Classic's
        building mode, or have gears and redstone at the same time, or have Humans, Finite worlds... The list goes on.
        This mod is like Old Days, but made for Beta 1.7.3. Be aware that the last versions are quite laggy and
        unstable. I recommend you play Alpha Mod Infdev, as that was the last stage of development of the mod before
        things got out of hand.
