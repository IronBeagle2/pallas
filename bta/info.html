    <h1>Better than Adventure!</h1>
    <p>
        Better than Adventure is a mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3. It was originally intended to add a few new
        features for a personalised experience, but has since grown into a full-fledged fork of Minecraft, adding dozens
        of new features for players to enjoy. Our philosophy is to add new gameplay that enhances and improves on the
        existing aspects of the game, without drastically changing the core experience. The question we like to ask
        ourselves is, "Would Mojang have added this to the vanilla game back in 2011?" If the answer is yes, it's
        probably a good candidate for BTA.
